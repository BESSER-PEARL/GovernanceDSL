**Policy**: 

- For now, one community member (Coraline Ada Ehmke) is the benevolent dictator (BD), and holds ultimate decision-making power, until the community is ready for a more inclusive model. 
- Coraline has appointed Tobie Langel and Don Goodman-Wilson as authoritative representatives of the broader Ethical Source community, and they are empowered to make decisions for the community with her oversight.
- The BD is responsible for implementing—or delegating implementation of—policies and other decisions.
