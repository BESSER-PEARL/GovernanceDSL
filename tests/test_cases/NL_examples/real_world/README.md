# Real World Examples

In this folder we will leave all examples of natural languages we find in real-world (GH for now).

I have created a `template.md` file so that if you want to introduce a new example, just copy paste the template into a new file, and fill it as indicated in the template.

Those examples that are incomplete, we cannot translate with our current version of the DSL or we still have to discuss the details of the translation, have an underscore before the name (e.g., `_tensorflow.md`).
