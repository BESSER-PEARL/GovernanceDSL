# Governance DSL Form Builder

A Gradio-based web interface for creating and editing governance policies using an intuitive form-based editor.

## Overview

The Form Builder provides a user-friendly way to define governance policies without writing DSL code directly. It includes:

- **Scope Tab**: Create projects, activities, and tasks.
- **Participant Tab**: Define profiles, roles, individuals, and agents.
- **Policy Tab**: Set up single or composed governance policies.
- **Live Preview**: View generated DSL code in real-time.
- **Download**: Export your governance policy as a text file, or just copy it from the live preview!

## Running Locally

To test the form builder locally run inside this folder:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_ui.py
```

This will start a local Gradio server at `http://localhost:7860`

## Online Version

The form builder is also available online (hosted on GitHub Pages using [Gradio Lite](https://www.gradio.app/4.44.1/guides/gradio-lite)):

**[Governance DSL Form Builder - Online](https://besser-pearl.github.io/GovernanceDSL/)**

The online version runs entirely in your browser using WebAssembly (Pyodide), with no backend server required.

## Usage

1. Fill out the form sections for your governance structure.
2. Watch the DSL code generate in the Live Preview panel.
3. Download your policy using the "âœ… Prepare Policy for Download" button.
4. You can then use the generated `.txt` in the [Decision Engine](github.com/BESSER-PEARL/GovernanceDecisionEngine).
