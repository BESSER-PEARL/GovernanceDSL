# GovernanceDSL

This repository contains the development of the governance DSL proposed for human-agent decision-making.
We first start by replicating the DSL presented by J.L.CÃ¡novas and J.Cabot.

* Folder `Xtext/` contains the definition of the grammar of the DSL using Xtext. It generates Python classes for defining the metamodel.
* Folder `ANTLR/` contains the definition of the grammar of the DSL using ANTLR. It generates the object bUML instances.
