**Policy**: 

**2.1.  Consensus-Based Decision Making**. Projects make decisions through consensus of the Maintainers. While explicit agreement of all Maintainers is preferred, it is not required for consensus. Rather, the Maintainers will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant view of the Contributors and nature of support and objections. The Maintainers will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements.

**2.2.  Appeal Process**. Decisions may be appealed by opening an issue and that appeal will be considered by the maintainers in good faith, who will respond in writing within a reasonable time. If the maintainers deny the appeal, the appeal my be brought before the TSC, who will also respond in writing in a reasonable time.
