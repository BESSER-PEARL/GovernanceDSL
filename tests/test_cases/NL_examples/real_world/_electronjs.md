**Further info**: Contributing guidelines found in [docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/development/pull-requests). There is a section for [Approval and Request Changes Workflow](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/development/pull-requests#approval-and-request-changes-workflow). 

**Policy**: 

All pull requests require approval from a Code Owner of the area you modified in order to land. 
~~Whenever a maintainer reviews a pull request they may request changes.~~
~~These may be small, such as fixing a typo, or may involve substantive changes. ~~
~~Such requests are intended to be helpful, but at times may come across as abrupt or unhelpful, especially if they do not include concrete suggestions on how to change them.~~

~~Try not to be discouraged. ~~
If you feel that a review is unfair, say so or seek the input of another project contributor. 
~~Often such comments are the result of a reviewer having taken insufficient time to review and are not ill-intended. ~~
~~Such difficulties can often be resolved with a bit of patience. ~~
~~That said, reviewers should be expected to provide helpful feedback.~~
